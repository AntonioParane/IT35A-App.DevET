Introduction:
The GRASPS model is used for a comparative analysis report on synthesizing literature findings and providing well-supported evaluations.

G - Goals:
The main objective of this comparative analysis report is to synthesize existing literature on a specific topic, identify key findings and gaps, and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the current state of research. In addition, the report aims to offer actionable insights that can inform future research or practical applications.

R - Roles:
Researcher: This role involves carrying out an extensive literature review of the relevant studies identified and synthesizing findings.
Analyst: This role requires evaluating the credibility and validity of the sources and constructing a well-supported argument.
Evaluator: This role involves assessing the strengths and limitations of existing research and suggesting areas for further investigation.

A - Audience:
The intended audience for this report would be academic researchers, students, policymakers, and practitioners with an interest in the specific field of study. The report should be readable by people who vary in their acumen about the subject matter.

S - Situation:
This may be a review and synthesis to understand the contemporary landscape of studies on a certain topic. Such a review can be motivated by emerging trends, technological advancements, or changes in policy or practice that require existing knowledge to be reviewed and synthesized.

P - Product:
A comparative analysis report that summarizes:

1. A summary of major findings from studies.
2. Similarities and differences between study outcomes.
3. Gaps in the literature and areas requiring further research are identified.
4. The methodologies used in the studies are critically evaluated.
5. Recommendations for future research directions and practical implications are provided.

The product to be developed in this case is a comparative analysis report. This report will synthesize findings from different literature sources and provide evidence-supported evaluations. The aim of the report is to set a stage of comparison between different studies, theories, or data sets to draw comprehensive conclusions and offer insights into the subject matter.
